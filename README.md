# ihxyz bot translation

Bot translations are split into three different sections.

1. The base command system (`base`). These are all the messages that are re-used across all bots, so only need to be translated once per language. Some examples include the "permission denied" and "something went wrong" messages.

2. QuizBot messages (`qb`). These are messages that are exclusively used in QuizBot.

3. PollBot Advanced messages (`pba`). These are messages that are exclusively used in PollBot Advanced.

Translation files for each of these three sections are stored in a separate folder shown in the list.
Each language has the messages stored in a single file per section.
