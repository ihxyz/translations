# BEFORE TRANSLATING: Make sure you have read and understand the information on the "Contributing" page and the notes below.
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
#  - Ensure all translations are surrounded by quotation marks (") as they currently are.
#    If you are including a quotation mark in a message, type \ before it.
#  - Do not edit the text before the ":". This is required for the bot to identify the messages.
#  - Do not remove any "{}" in the messages. These are placeholders for values that the bot will insert.
#    For example, the message "Quiz ID: {}" may become "Quiz ID: 123456" when it's displayed by the bot.
#  - Do not remove or edit lines starting with "#". These do not need to be translated.
#  - \n means new line. Please try to keep the newlines in the same place as they currently are to ensure messages are readable.
#  - We use Discord's formatting codes in the messages. Please keep these as they are.
#  - Do not translate command names in messages.
#  - Do not translate any of the following text: "QuizBot", "QuizBot Premium", "ihxyz".
